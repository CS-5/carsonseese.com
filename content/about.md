# ~$ whoami

My name is Carson Seese. I am a 20 year-old-student, tech enthusiast, [homelabber](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction),
and tinkerer (Doubtful that's a word, but we'll go for it). To save everyone time, 
here's my TLDR, but feel free to keep scrolling if you're curious.

## TLDR

- Sophomore at the Pennsylvania College of Technology studying Information Assurance and Cybersecurity
- CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ Certified
- [Co-Presented at BSides DC 2019 _"Hands on Writing Malware in Go"_](https://gist.github.com/CS-5/c251f173e1e8ddd46c1b020427cb239b)
- Operate my own homelab currently residing in my parent's basement
- Alumna and Mentor of [FIRST Robotics Competition team: "Biohazard"](https://biohazard4050.org)
- Check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/CS-5), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsonseese/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carsons_5)

# Programming Languages

I 95% (more or less) self-taught when it comes to programming, so there is still
a lot I have to learn. Nevertheless, the languages I have experience with are rated
from highest to lowest for anyone who's curious.

- Java
- Go
- LabVIEW
- JavaScript
- Python
- Bash/Shell Scripting


# Homelab

This wouldn't be a proper "About" page if it didn't at some point mention what it's
being hosted on. Although I'm not necessarily pursuing a field in network 
infrastructure, one might say tinkering with servers, switches, and cables is a
hobby of mine. A somewhat outdated post about my homelab can be found [here](https://blog.carsonseese.com/homelab-v1-0-0/),
with a more updated plan of how I planned on upgrading the network [here](https://blog.carsonseese.com/homelab-v2-the-network-upgrade/)
(spoiler alert: the upgrade was successful). I'm hoping to setup a dedicated page
about my homelab at some point, but it might be a bit before I get around to that
unfortunately.

- [**R**eally **S**imple **D**omain **G**eneration **A**lgorithm](https://github.com/CS-5/rsdga)
  - A basic Go library I wrote for the BSides presentation which generates domains in a predictable fashion.
- [exfil2dns](https://github.com/CS-5/exfil2dns)
  - Another basic Go library also for BSides which takes data, chunks it, and sends it out in the form of DNS queries.
- [disgomux](https://github.com/CS-5/disgomux)
  - A somewhat funky multiplexer for [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). It's not perfect, but it works.
- [GoElsewhere](https://github.com/CS-5/GoElsewhere)
  - Ever wanted to self-host a URL shortener (basiclly a HTTP redirector with a fancy UI)? Well now you can! _(There's obviously still a lot of work to be done)_
- [.dotfiles](https://github.com/CS-5/.dotfiles)
  - A collection of my personal dotfiles. I don't necessarily recommend copying these, but if you have any suggestions or examples, feel free to make a PR! I am still new to vim and tmux.

## The Full Story

I started getting interested in programming right around the time Minecraft started
to gain popularity. This popularity drove me to start learning Java and tinkering
with Git and GitHub, all of which were mind blowing to me at the time.

Not much later in 2013, I joined a high school robotics team which operated as a 
club in my local 4-H chapter. This expierence really helped put my programming 
and teamwork skills to the test as I rapidly began developing my growing skillset. 
I worked my way through the ranks on my team holding positions such as lead 
programmer and media manager, until I eventually became the team captain in 2018 
(my last year on the team).

Fall of 2016 I enrolled at the Franklin County Career and Technology Center
studying Information Systems Technology. Our coursework was taught to CompTIA's
A+ and Network+ certifications, as well as Cisco's CCNA. While at the FCCTC, I
performed many service calls throughout the school and learned a lot about 
"enterprise" networking. While a student, I managed to get a sumemr job as a Jr.
System Administrator at the FCCTC where I did everything from installing Windows
on new computers to cabling installations to basic hardware and software
troubleshooting.

After spending 3 semesters studying information systems at the FCCTC, I secured
my CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications. I then went on to attend
the Pennsylvania College of Technology's Information Assurance and Cybersecurity
program in which I am currently a sophmore.

Summer of 2019 I had the opportunity to intern at IronNet, a cybersecurity firm
specializing in defense of entire networks. While at IronNet I had a chance to 
write a basic network auditing CLI tool in Go, which really helped some basic
programming fundamentals I had missed in years prior finally click. In the process
of writing my tool, the opportunity to co-present at a security conference was
presented to me. Although hesitant, I knew I'd me missing a great opportunity if
I said no, so I went for it. During our talk at BSides DC 2019, we detailed some
of the techniques used by attackers when trying to encode, transmit, and
recieve information across a network. The process of preparing the talk was not
and insignifigant amount of work, but was extremely rewarding in the end.

So that brings us to today (and me making a reminder to update this after the
summer).
